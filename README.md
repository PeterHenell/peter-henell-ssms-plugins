This is a sample add for Red Gate's SSMS ecosystem project.

[The SSMS ecosystem project homepage](http://www.red-gate.com/ssmsecosystem)

[The shared interfaces are available for reference](https://github.com/red-gate/SIPFrameworkShared). You should not compile them youself, because they must be signed with the Red Gate key.
